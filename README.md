### Environment Variable Configuration

You need to configure the following environment variables (or include them in your `devspace.yaml` file):

- `SPLUNK_ARCADE_OBSERVABILITY_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `SPLUNK_ARCADE_OBSERVABILITY_REALM`
- `SPLUNK_ARCADE_DOMAIN` **TBD**

For K3s, if youâ€™re using a local registry, configure the following environment variable:

- `SPLUNK_ARCADE_REGISTRY` to `localhost:<port>/splunk-arcade`

---

### Deployment

To deploy the application, run the following command:

```bash
devspace deploy
```

---

### Cleanup and Purge

To clean up or purge the deployment, use the following command:

```bash
devspace purge
```

---

### Manual Cleanup

Uninstalling a Helm chart does not automatically remove Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) or other resources created by the portal. To manually clean them up, run:

- To clean PVCs:
  ```bash
  make clean-pvcs
  ```

- To clean players:
  ```bash
  make clean-players
  ```

Make sure you're configured to use the `splunk-arcade` namespace before running these commands.

---

### Future Plans

In the future, we can set up a cron job to automatically prune these resources after a certain period.
